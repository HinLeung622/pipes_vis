# pipes_vis
A small, interactive GUI/visualizer tool for SPS spectra, powered by Adam Carnall's Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation (BAGPIPES) <br>

Currently the only way to install this package is through cloning from github. I will try to make it pip-installable in the future. <br>

Dependencies: bagpipes, numpy, matplotlib, astropy (visualizer still works even if you do not install multinest and pymultinest as instructed by bagpipes' installation) <br>

For requests regarding not wanting to install the powerful but multinest-dependent bagpipes, I can include the model-generation part of bagpipes and the underlying SSP grids as a part of this package. To be done in the future.<br>
