# pipes_vis
A small, interactive GUI/visualizer tool for SPS spectra, powered by Adam Carnall's Bayesian Analysis of Galaxies for Physical Inference and Parameter EStimation (BAGPIPES) (https://bagpipes.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) <br>

To install, type `pip install pipes_vis`. <br>

You can find examples and documumentations of the tool in this jupyter notebook: https://github.com/HinLeung622/pipes_vis/blob/main/pipes_vis_example.ipynb

Dependencies: bagpipes, numpy, matplotlib, astropy, scipy (visualizer still works even if you do not install multinest and pymultinest as instructed by bagpipes' installation) <br>

For requests regarding making the visualizer avaliable as a web interactive tool much like sengi https://www.christopherlovell.co.uk/sengi/, it will likely require rewriting large portions of the code in javascript or some other web-purposed languages. Please contact me if you are interested in doing this/want this to be done.<br>
